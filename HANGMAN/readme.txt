Dear Beta tester,

Thank you for participating in the pre-release testing of HANGMANâ„¢.
There are over 630 words in this game. Some phrases from my personal collection have been omitted due to having multiple words, so only single word phrases are included.

Steps:
1.Compile the source code
2.Open the executable program
3.ENJOY, PUNY HUMAN!

Do NOT look at the data.txt file.[SPOILERS]

WARNING:
While guessing, only type one character followed by ENTER (or as the program specifies for guessing the whole word). Other inputs such as spaces or new lines before typing the character induce kernel leakage. Some words do contain apostrophes which do not cause any issues.

CAUTION:
The word entries have been imported automatically from a multi-decade accumulated list and as such may induce cringe from time to time.

If you happen to find a bug or a spelling mistake, please don't tell me.
I am very sensitive.
